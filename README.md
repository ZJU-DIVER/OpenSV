## Overview

**Shapley-based values** are prevalent data valuation approaches.

## What Can You Do via OpenSV?

- Use the implementations of current Shapley-based values.* We have implemented various of Shapley-based values and corresponding SOTA computation techniques. You can easily call and understand these methods.
- Design your own data valuation work. With the extensibility of OpenSV, you can quickly practice your data valuation ideas.

## Installation

**Note: Please use Python 3.8+ for OpenSV**

### Using Pip

Our repo is tested on Python **3.8+** and PyTorch **1.8.1+**, install OpenSV using pip as follows:




```shell
pip install opensv
```

To play with the latest features, you can also install OpenSV from the source.

### Using Git

Clone the repository from github:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ZJU-DIVER/OpenSV.git
cd opensv
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

Modify the code
